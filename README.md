# **Preprocess dataset**

* Voxel51 SLAKE dataset
* To download the dataset, run the **Load_SLAKE.py** script.

# **Prepare Experiments**

* Once the SLAKE dataset is fully loaded in, the goal is to successfully load in the isolated close-ended SLAKE images with questions, assuming that bounding boxes are provided for all images.
* We use MedGemma to generate captioning, more specifically the 4b instruction-tuned model. We don't keep the code in this github because the purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the main VCTP pipeline.
* MedGemma is still open source, and captions can be generated by prompt tuning. We also still provide the global and regional captions, along with other datasets specified in the repository. 
* The main step after loading the SLAKE dataset is to load LLama 3.1 and BioMedCLIP. It is recommended to load in LLama 3.1 first, and then load BioMedCLIP later. You can use the respective code-files provided. Keep in mind that if you are running the ablation, only LLama 3.1 is needed. 
* Once the models are fully loaded, use the function files depending on the experiment you want to run. Make sure that the functions utilize the few shot examples provided in the repository files. We have provided the specific locations on where the FewShotExamples will be loaded, named examples5 in the functions.
* When the functions and the models are fully loaded in and functional, it is time to iterate through the dataset and cross-check outputs to attain accuracy. We use the code provided, starting with run and then ending with the respective desired experiment.
* The run functions may need to be slightly modified depending on the format of the SLAKE files you input, but to mitigate this, we provide the files ourselves in the repository. 

# **Run Experiments**

* Run_MedVCTP.py for MedVCTP
* Run_Ablation.py for Ablation study
