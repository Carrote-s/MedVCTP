The ribs and spine are intact.\n*   **Anatomical Structures and Spatial Relationships:** The nodule is located in the right upper lobe of the lung, which is adjacent to the mediastinum. The nodule is located in the periphery of the lung. The heart is located in the center of the chest, anterior to the lungs. The great vessels (aorta and pulmonary artery) are located in the mediastinum. The ribs and spine are located on either side of the chest.\n"
